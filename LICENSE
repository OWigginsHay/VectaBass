VectaBass Agents Framework
==========================

VectaBass is committed to revolutionizing the interaction with AI Virtual Assistants (AIVAs) by offering an innovative platform that empowers users to create and manage autonomous AI agents using an object-oriented approach. Our dual licensing model is designed to facilitate community development and innovation while supporting commercial applications.
